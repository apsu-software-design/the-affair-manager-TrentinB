# The Affair Manager

This repo contains code for a command-line application to manage events (called "affairs" in the code), created as part of an assignment for CSCI 4602 at Austin Peay State University.

The below questions should be answered _in detail_ regarding your submission!

##### Reflect on how you determined the architecture of your application. What process did you use to determine which classes to define? #####
> The affair manager was the main class I defined. The member, affair, and organization classes were what I used to hold and organize the data. In hindsight the List class was completely unneccessary and not having it at all likely wouldve made my life a good bit easier. I tried to keep the data classes as simple as possible with next to no methods. One ended up with a toString which I feel is valid and ok, but another wound up with a method that I feel like I could've fit better elsewhere. 


##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I talked with Logan about the assignment and he helped me with some of the early stuff to get started but we took wildly different approaches in some cases. 

##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> I unfortunately didn't really "complete" the assignment but I spend a good four hours or so on it.


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
> 8. Even though I didn't finish it I feel it was a lack of time since I procrastinated more than anything. I had a few really tough sticking points that took a while to get past but in general I feel the assignment was pretty alright. 


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> I still have zero idea how to handle the search methods without code duplication so that would be my number one thing. My search functions still aren't working and I don't know why but I feel like that's more of a me thing.
